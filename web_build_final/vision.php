           We are on the path to fill the gaps in our society. We will commence by providing online 
           materials  and gradually we will try to cover up all the aspects of society. We are beginning 
           from online contents as if look back, we find that few years ago we were college students and 
           we do understand what any student or faculty need for the courses.Students try to reach coaching's 
           institute but merely few of them do reach a satisfaction level either in concept clearance or in 
           retrieval of knowledge.We are not against the concept of coaching institution. What we just want
           is, to give it a perfection in our own way and which do connects the dots and fill the gap which still exists there.
           Knowledge sharing is very essential but if it`s not shared in a perfect way, then it do raise 
           certain doubts in others brain ,to whom the knowledge was shared and the concept becomes an 
           unfulfilled entity in human brain. In order to fill this gap we are trying to bring up a 
           platform which will begin to breathe soon.
