            It is a great honor for us to introduce ourself. As you have already started to 
            read, it won't  take much time. So you must be thinking from where this name 
            <span class='black-text' style="font-weight: bold">"XGARBAGELAB"</span> came into light. Before, it 
            takes much time of yours, let's come to the reality. As we lived almost for 2 
            years in a garage during our college days. We thought and mapped our idea and 
            transformed it into a workplace. So we just derived the name XGARBAGE LAB from 
            there and as you know X belongs to everyone. We are on a mission and we want 
            to achieve that with a vision which lays down the path perfectly to reach there. 
            We are a small unit of developers working smartly to achieve what we actually 
            aim for.
